### **Risks, Mitigations & Recommendations**
- **Shallow AI Interaction**
  - *Fix:* Prioritize RAG memory. AI needs long-term recall.
  - *Recommendation:* **Don’t ship without memory.**

- **Quest System Feels Like a To-Do List**
  - *Fix:* Lean into adaptive algorithms.
  - *Recommendation:* **Treat it as a core R&D focus.**

- **UI/UX Weakness**
  - *Fix:* Prioritize polish and animations.
  - *Recommendation:* **UX is a feature, not a layer.**

---

### **Top 3 Bold Strategic Opinions**

1. **Empathy is the Product**
   - Build trust through tone and support. The relationship is the USP.

2. **Own the Adaptive Quest IP**
   - Proprietary algorithms = defensibility and value.

3. **Design for Multimodal Future**
   - Voice, AR, and ambient AI should be future-proofed now.
